[BTQuickApp](https://github.com/balram3429/BTQuickApp) uses [LGSideMenuController](https://github.com/Friend-LGA/LGSideMenuController) underneath, to create the Menu & acts as a wrapper to generate an App quickly. You just need to pass the class name of your HomeScreen & pass few sideMenu classes & you are done. :+1:
